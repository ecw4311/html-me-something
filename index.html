      <h2> My Research</h2>
      <p> I study the co-development of personality, well-being, and health to understand how people can live <b>happier, healthier lives</b>.
      First, I investigate how personality and well-being change across time. <i>For example, how does life satisfaction change during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood?</i> Second, I examine how personality and well-being influence one another across time. <i> For example, does higher neuroticism serve as a risk factor for worse well-being trajectories?</i> Finally, I study the long-term effects of personality and well-being change on important health outcomes. <i> For example, do changes in positive and negative affect predict mortality? </i></p>
      <p>I employ a multi-method approach to answer these questions, including longitudinal, experience sampling, and experimental methods. To promote robustness, replicability, and transparency in my work, I have started preregistering all new data collection and secondary data analyses on the Open Science Framework. When possible, I use coordinated analysis techniques which test the same research question using the same statistical model across multiple datasets. 
        Coordinated analysis increase the replicability and generalizability of results, by promoting confidence that the findings are not an idiosyncrasy of a single dataset, but rather an aggregation of harmonized models across heterogeneous datasets.

        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> I received my PhD in Social-Personality Psychology from the University of California, Berkeley in 2019. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the department of Medical Social Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. My research lies at the intersections of personality, social, and health psychology.

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<h3>Personality Change and Mortality</h3>
<p>A growing body of research has shown that personality changes across the lifespan, and that there are substantial individual differences in the trajectories of personality change. 
  Moreover, personality levels have been robustly associated with mortality risk. In a coordinated analysis of 16 longitudinal studies, I am examining whether personality change predicts mortality risk. For example, do greater increases in neuroticism across time predict increased mortality risk? 
     Results will increase our understanding of the relationship between lifespan personality development and health.</p>

  <h3>Personality Predictors of Psychological Resilience Amidst Physical Impairment</h3>
<p>Aging-related functional impairment is often experienced as an adverse event, with accompanying declines in psychological health. However, some individuals demonstrate resilience by maintaining average-to-high levels of psychological health amidst functional impairment. 
  Personality and cognitive functioning are important predictors of both trait resilience and successful aging, suggesting that they may be key factors that predict psychological resilience amidst functional impairment. 
  I am currently testing this hypothesis in a coordinated analysis of 17 studies. The analysis plan is preregistered (osf.io/cx7jw) and analyses are underway or completed for all 17 samples. 
  This research will help to elucidate how some people maintain high quality of life in the face of aging-related physical health declines.</p>

<h3>Context-Appropriate Emotion Regulation</h3>
<p>The ability to adaptively regulate one’s emotions is crucial to well-being. However, no single strategy is adaptive in all contexts; adaptiveness depends on using strategies flexibly. 
  Cognitive reappraisal is a commonly used and commonly studied emotion regulation strategy that is generally considered beneficial for well-being. However, 
  previous research has found that the benefits of reappraisal may be limited to the context of uncontrollable stress. 
  In uncontrollble situations When changing the situation is futile, it may be better to use reappraisal to change one's emotions. 
  In contrast, when the situation is relatively controllable, it may be better to take action to change the situation itself.
  To test this hypothesis, I experimentally manipulated both reappraisal and the controllability of a laboratory stressor to test effects on emotion, motivation, performance, and autonomic nervous system physiology. Analyses are underway; the preregistration can be found at osf.io/73wzq/. 
</p>
<p>  If reappraisal is beneficial in the context of uncontrollable stress and inert or even harmful in the context of controllable stress, it follows that individuals who have better “strategy-situation fit” (i.e., who use
  reappraisal more during uncontrollable versus controllable stressors) should experience
  psychological health benefits, beyond benefits associated with habitual reappraisal use. In a test
  of this hypothesis, Haines and colleagues (2016) found that strategy-situation fit in daily life was
  associated with greater well-being (N=74). I am currently conducting a preregistered direct replication 
   this study (osf.io/uf738). Together, these studies will increase our understanding of the role of context in determining the adaptiveness of particular emotion regulation strategies.
